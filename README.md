## **Vagrant Cloud**

This box is available on [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/felipecassiors/boxes/dev-ubuntu-20.04). For using it:

1. Create a new folder on your computer, like `C:\my-dev-ubuntu-20.04`.
2. Open a new terminal there and run `vagrant init felipecassiors/dev-ubuntu-20.04`.
3. Notice that a new file called `Vagrantfile` was created. In this file, you can set your personal options for your VM. For a good example, check [my-dev-ubuntu-20.04](https://github.com/felipecassiors/my-dev-ubuntu-20.04).
4. Run `vagrant up` and be happy!

## **Automated Build**

This box is automatically built by [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/felipecassiors/dev-ubuntu-20.04). Every new commit triggers a new build. We use [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to determine whether we need to release a new version. The loop also tests the new deployed box before releasing it by running `vagrant up` on that version. If it fails, it doesn't release the version and deletes it. For more details check the [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) and also the [`ci/deploy.sh`](ci/deploy.sh).

The whole process is:

1. Check out the repository
2. Install the dependencies (VirtualBox and Vagrant)
3. `vagrant up`
4. `vagrant package`
5. Run `semantic-release` to determine whether the build should be released or not and generate the release notes
6. Create a new version and upload the box to the Vagrant Cloud
7. Try to run a `vagrant up` of the uploaded box
8. If the last step succeeds, release the version on [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/felipecassiors/boxes/dev-ubuntu-20.04), commit the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and create a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/felipecassiors/dev-ubuntu-20.04/releases).

## Build it manually

Clone the repository, start a new terminal there, and run:

``` bash
vagrant up
```

After the provision is done, you can turn the VM into a box:

``` bash
vagrant package
```

## Deploy

If you want to deploy it in your Vagrant Cloud, you can use the [`ci/deploy.sh`](scripts/deploy.sh). It needs the `VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable to be set before running.

``` bash
ci/deploy.sh
```
